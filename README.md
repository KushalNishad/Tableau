# Covid 19 World Vaccination Progress
This dashboard shows the global progress of COVID-19 vaccination as of October 2021. It displays various metrics and charts, such as:
- The total number of vaccine doses administered, fully vaccinated people, and the percentage of population fully vaccinated by country and region.
- The daily and cumulative vaccination trends by country and region, with the option to filter by date range and vaccine type.
- The map of the world with different colors indicating the percentage of population fully vaccinated by country, with the option to zoom in and out and hover over each country for more details.
The ranking of the top 10 countries by the percentage of population fully vaccinated, with the option to sort by ascending or descending order and see the exact numbers and percentages.
The dashboard is interactive and allows users to explore the data and compare different countries and regions. The dashboard also provides the source of the data and the date of the last update. The dashboard is created using Tableau, a data visualization tool. [View Online](https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZFZDDGY3R?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
